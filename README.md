Full Stack development of a website that uses MEAN structure to work with participants and organizers of art workshops, with admin supervision.

Some of the features include:
1. Register/Login
2. Password and other user info change
3. Forgot Password sent to user mail
4. Fillter/Sort and top 5 liked workshops
5. Communication between organizers and participants
6. Liking, Subscribing, Unsubscribing half an hour before start, Commenting
7. Notifying via mail when there are free spaces available
8. Adding new workshops, becoming an organiser
9. Using functional integrated OpenStreetMap 

And many more!

Note: If you are trying to run this project, when running "npm install" and "npm audit fix" run with "--force" because there are some conflict with packages that don't effect the performance, therefore no need looking into. Also note that MongoDB was filled with examples that date to january 2023, so anywhere that date is relevant (mostly workshops) change them to whatever dateTime works for you.

If you have any questions feel free to ask in "Discussions"! ^^
